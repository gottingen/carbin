Using carbin
==============================

---------------------------------------
Installing cmake packages
---------------------------------------

When package is installed from one of the package sources(see :ref:`pkg-src`) using the :ref:`install` command, ``carbin`` will run the equivalent cmake commands to install it::

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$CARBIN_PREFIX/carbin/carbin.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CARBIN_PREFIX ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --build . --target install

However, ``carbin`` will always create the build directory out of source. The ``carbin.cmake`` is a toolchain file that is setup by ``carbin``, so that cmake can find the installed packages. Other settings can be added about the toolchain as well(see :ref:`init`).

The ``carbin.cmake`` toolchain file can be useful for cmake projects to use. This will enable cmake to find the dependencies installed by ``carbin`` as well::

    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$CARBIN_PREFIX/carbin/carbin.cmake ..

Instead of passing in the toolchain, ``carbin`` provides a build command to take of this already(see :ref:`build`). This will configure cmake with ``carbin.cmake`` toolchain file and build the project::

    carbin build

By default, it will build the ``all`` target, but a target can be specified as well::

    carbin build --target some_target

For projects that don't use cmake, then its matter of searching for the dependencies in ``CARBIN_PREFIX``. Also, it is quite common for packages to provide ``pkg-config`` files for managing dependencies. So, ``carbin`` provides a ``pkg-config`` command that will search for the dependencies that ``carbin`` has installed. For example, ``carbin pkg-config`` can be used to link in the dependencies for zlib without needing cmake::

    carbin install zlib,http://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.11.tar.gz
    g++ src.cpp `carbin pkg-config zlib --cflags --libs`


------------------------------------------------
Installing non-cmake packages
------------------------------------------------


carbin can install non-cmake packages as well. Due note that non-cmake build systems do not have a way to tell the build where the dependencies are installed. carbin will set environment variables such as ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` and ``PATH``, but if the dependencies are not found using pkg-config or these standard environment variables then you will need to consult the build scripts as to what protocol is needed to resolve the dependencies.

For packages that don't support building with cmake. A cmake file can be provided to build the package. This can either build the sources or bootstrap the build system for the package::

    carbin install SomePackage --cmake mycmake.cmake

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Header-only libraries
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For libraries that are header-only, ``carbin`` provides a cmake file ``header`` to install the headers. For example, Boost.Preprocessor library can be installed like this::

    carbin install boostorg/preprocessor --cmake header

By default, it installs the headers in the 'include' directory, but this can be changed by setting the ``INCLUDE_DIR`` cmake variable::

    carbin install boostorg/preprocessor --cmake header -DINCLUDE_DIR=include

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Binaries
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For binaries, ``carbin`` provides a cmake file ``binary`` which will install all the files in the package without building any source files. For example, the clang binaries for ubuntu can be installed like this::

    carbin install clang,http://llvm.org/releases/3.9.0/clang+llvm-3.9.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz  --cmake binary


""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
CMake Subdirectory
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If cmake is not in the top-level directory this will use the cmake in a subdirectory::

    carbin install google/protobuf --cmake subdir

By default, it uses a directory named ``cmake``, but this can be changed by setting the ``CMAKE_DIR`` variable::

    carbin install sandstorm-io/capnproto --cmake subdir -DCMAKE_DIR=c++

.. _boost-cmake:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Boost
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A cmake ``boost`` is provided to install boost libraries as well::

    carbin install boost,http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.62.0/boost_1_62_0.tar.bz2 --cmake boost

Libraries can be selected with cmake variables ``BOOST_WITH_`` and ``BOOST_WITHOUT_``. For example, just Boost.Filesystem(and it dependencies) can be built as::

    carbin install boost,http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.62.0/boost_1_62_0.tar.bz2 --cmake boost -DBOOST_WITH_FILESYSTEM=1

Also, everything can be built except Boost.Python like the following::

    carbin install boost,http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.62.0/boost_1_62_0.tar.bz2 --cmake boost -DBOOST_WITHOUT_PYTHON=1

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Meson
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A cmake ``meson`` is provided to build packages that use the meson build system. CMake variables of the form ``MESON_SOME_VAR`` are passed to meson as a variable ``some-var``.

To use meson you will need python 3.5 or later, with meson and ninja installed. It can be installed with ``pip3 install meson ninja``. carbin does not provide an installation of meson.

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Autotools
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A cmake ``autotools`` is provided to build autotools-based libraries. Autotools is not a portable build system and may not work on all platforms.

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Make
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A cmake ``make`` is provided to build makefile-based libraries. This will invoke ``make`` and then ``make install``. It will set the ``PREFIX`` variable to the installation location. Makefile is not a portable build system and may not work on all platforms.
